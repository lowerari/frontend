            <p>To a certain extent, being in control of your mind is being in control of your attention—that is, what you pay attention to and how long you pay attention to it.</p>
            <br />
            <p>In many ways, mindfulness practice is the practice of controlling your attention. With a lot of practice, you get better at it. <span className="bold">Mindfulness reduces automaticity of attentional processes.</span></p>
            <br />
            <p>Often we react to thoughts and images as if they are facts. We get entangled in the events in the mind and cannot tell the difference between a fact in the world and thoughts or images of the world. Mindfulness, practiced often and diligently, can <span className="bold">improve your skills of seeing the difference between facts and images and thoughts about facts.</span></p>
            <br />
            <p>Mindfulness is the practice of observing what is going on inside yourself as well as outside, without doing anything to change it. Thus, in some ways, you can consider it as a practice of observing things without reacting to or trying to change them. The ability to experience without reacting is essential in many situations. Mindfulness practice improves your ability to be less immediately reactive to everyday situations. <span className="bold">It gives you a chance to take whatever time is needed before you react</span></p>

            <br />
            <p>The idea is that if we truly experience each present moment of our lives—if we let go of mental constructs, ideas, and judgments about what is—then we will ultimately see that our worst imaginings of reality are not true. We will at some point see that life itself is unceasing change, and also that clinging to any moment of reality is ultimately not in our best interests.</p>

            <h3 className="slideHeading">Be Present in Your Own Life</h3>
            <p>Mindfulness is the practice of being in the present. It is being present to your own life. Many people find at some point that their life is whizzing by and they are missing a lot of it. Children are growing up; friends that we care about are moving away; we are getting older. It is easy to be so focused on distractions, the past, or the future that we actually miss many positive things in our lives.</p>
            <br />
            <p><span className="bold">Example:</span> If you are walking in the forest, and you slightly change directions without knowing this, it may not take long before you are really far from where you were originally going.</p>

                    <li>Avoidance has no permanent effect on our well-being. It may temporarily decrease painful emotions, but when we avoid and escape painful events now, they will be painful in the future.</li>

            <p>Mindfulness is focusing on the present moment and on the people we are with now. It is very easy to be around people but far away—thinking about something or someone else, looking for someone else to talk to, wishing we were somewhere else, planning what we will do next, dreaming about other things, focusing on our pain or our suffering. We are not present to the people around us. Others, of course, often notice this. They may eventually pull away from us; it is hard for them to be ignored in this way.</p>

            <h3 className="slideHeading">Connection to the Universe</h3>
            <p>Everyone and everything in the universe is connected. As physicists would point out, the universe is a network of interconnected atoms, cells, and particles that are constantly moving and changing. We touch the air around us that touches everything else around us, and on and on. Each move that we make interacts with the entire universe at some point. It is this point that we need to get across. However, knowing that we are interconnected is one thing; experiencing it is another. Many people feel isolated and alone. Their experience of themselves is as outsiders. But once we see that the world and universe is an interconnected network, we can see that there is really no outside or inside. Thus our experience is built on the delusion of separation. Mindfulness is aimed at enhancing our experience of the universe as it is, without delusion or distortion.</p>

            <h3 className="slideHeading">Essential &quot;Goodness&quot;</h3>
            <p>Many individuals experience themselves as bad, unworthy, or somehow defective. Mindfulness is the practice of seeing ourselves as we are—ultimately simply ourselves and inherently neither good nor bad, but rather just as we are. From this perspective, all things in the universe, including ourselves, are good. (Although the use of the term “goodness” may seem to contradict the notion that “good” and “bad” are concepts in the mind of the observer, we cannot deny the use of “good” as an adjective and “goodness” as a term to denote a quality of something. Thus it is important not to move too far into a rigid notion that we can never use the term “good,” as in saying “Good boy” to a dog when he does something he was taught, or “Good job” to a colleague at work. Once we have given up “good” and “bad” as judgments, we can revert to using them as shorthand comments about what is observed.)</p>
