# MyDBTJourney
Welcome to MyDBTJourney!
This website is still currently under construction.

## About
MyDBTJourney is a web application that provides users with a platform to learn Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) skills. DBT is a type of cognitive-behavioral therapy that is used to treat individuals with borderline personality disorder (BPD). It is also used to treat other mental health conditions such as depression, anxiety, and eating disorders.

MyDBTJourney is designed to help users learn DBT skills in a structured and interactive way. The application includes a series of lessons and quizzes that cover the four modules of DBT: mindfulness, distress tolerance, emotion regulation, and interpersonal effectiveness.

Users can sign up for an account, log in, and track their progress as they complete the lessons and quizzes. The application also provides users with a profile page where they can view their course progress and update their account information.

This site is not intended as a replacement for therapy/professional led mental healthcare. All content on this site is adapted from Dr. Marsha Linehan's DBT Skills Training Manual, Second Edition.

## How to Use
This site is built using React and Django Rest Framework (you can find the back end in my other repo!)

Use is fairly straightforward for the front end:
- Clone/copy the repo
- npm install
- To run: npm run dev
- Don't forget: full functionality won't be achieved unless you hook up to the back end! (instructions for the back end can be found in the corresponding repo)
- At the moment, the website looks best in mobile view (I'm slowly working on desktop view, but it's not a priority at present)

## TODO
There is a LOT to adapt and I am but one woman, so there is still a lot left to do:
- Finish mindfulness courses
- Create distress tolerance courses
- Create emotion regulation courses
- Create interpersonal effectiveness courses
- Make mindfulness skills practice
- Make distress tolerance skills practice
- Make emotion regulation skills practice
- Make interpersonal skills practice
- Connect diary to back end and create functionality in the front end
- Work on desktop view
- Little UI improvements
